SQL can be more challenging to work with Node.js compared to NoSQL databases like MongoDB due to several reasons. While Node.js is well-suited for asynchronous, event-driven programming, and JSON data manipulation, SQL databases have a relational data model and rely on synchronous, query-based interactions. In this detailed explanation, we'll explore the complexities and obstacles that developers may encounter when integrating SQL databases with Node.js.

**1. Asynchronous Nature of Node.js:**

Node.js is known for its non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model, which allows it to handle concurrent connections efficiently. Asynchronous programming in Node.js is achieved through the use of callbacks, Promises, or async/await, allowing developers to execute non-blocking operations and avoid the overhead of thread-based concurrency.

**2. Synchronous Nature of SQL:**

SQL databases, with their relational data model and traditional query-based interactions, are designed around synchronous operations. SQL queries block the event loop in Node.js, which can lead to poor performance, especially when dealing with complex or long-running queries. Synchronous operations can cause bottlenecks, reducing the ability of Node.js to handle concurrent requests effectively.

**3. Callback Hell:**

When using SQL databases with Node.js, developers often encounter the "callback hell" problem. SQL queries are usually executed asynchronously, which means they require callbacks to handle the results. When multiple queries are involved, the nesting of callbacks can become deep and hard to manage, resulting in highly convoluted and unreadable code.

**4. Lack of Native JSON Support:**

Node.js natively supports JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), making it easy for developers to work with JSON data. However, SQL databases do not natively handle JSON data, and interactions require conversions between JSON and SQL formats, adding complexity and overhead to the codebase.

**5. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Complexities:**

To mitigate the challenges of integrating SQL with Node.js, developers often rely on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like Sequelize, Knex.js, or TypeORM. ORM libraries abstract away the SQL syntax and allow developers to interact with the database using JavaScript objects, providing a more familiar and expressive interface.

However, working with ORM libraries can introduce complexities of its own. Developers need to learn the ORM's syntax and sometimes compromise on SQL optimization to benefit from the convenience of working with JavaScript objects.

**6. Schema Migrations and Changes:**

SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of tables and relationships between them must be defined in advance. When changes to the schema are necessary, such as adding or modifying columns, developers often need to perform schema migrations. Schema migrations can be error-prone and may require downtime during database updates, making the process more challenging to manage, especially in production environments.

**7. Query Complexity:**

SQL databases excel in handling complex data relationships and joining data from multiple tables. While these capabilities are powerful, writing complex SQL queries can be challenging, particularly when dealing with many-to-many relationships or complex data models. Building and maintaining complex SQL queries can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

**8. Data Type Mismatch:**

JavaScript and SQL have different data types and data representations. Developers must be cautious when handling data conversions between the two systems to avoid issues such as data loss or unexpected behavior.

**9. Lack of Flexibility:**

SQL databases are rigid when it comes to schema changes and data manipulation. Adding or modifying data fields in an SQL database may require altering existing tables and updating large amounts of data. This process can be cumbersome and less flexible compared to NoSQL databases, which natively support dynamic schemas.

**10. Scalability Challenges:**

While SQL databases are powerful and capable of scaling, they may face challenges in horizontally scaling compared to NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Horizontal scaling, which involves distributing data across multiple servers, can be more straightforward to implement with NoSQL databases designed for this purpose.

**11. Complex Data Joins:**

In SQL databases, joining data from multiple tables is a common operation, especially for complex data queries. Handling complex joins can lead to increased development time and require careful optimization for performance.

**12. Learning Curve for SQL:**

For developers who are primarily experienced with JavaScript and NoSQL databases, the transition to SQL databases can be challenging. Learning SQL syntax and understanding the nuances of relational data modeling may require additional effort and time.

**13. Complexity in Database Management:**

SQL databases often require more intensive database management tasks, such as query optimization, index management, and performance tuning. While these tasks are essential for achieving optimal performance, they can add an extra layer of complexity for Node.js developers who are more accustomed to the simplicity of NoSQL databases.

**14. Development Overhead:**

Working with SQL databases can introduce development overhead due to factors such as defining and maintaining table schemas, writing complex SQL queries, and handling schema migrations. These overheads can be significant, especially in fast-paced development environments.

**15. Limited Support for Hierarchical Data:**

SQL databases are not inherently designed to handle hierarchical data structures like JSON or nested documents. Although developers can implement hierarchical data models, it may require additional effort and compromise some of the benefits of working with a NoSQL database.

**16. No Native Support for Real-Time Change Streams:**

Real-time change streams, a powerful feature supported natively by NoSQL databases like MongoDB, enable applications to monitor changes in the database in real-time. This feature is not natively supported in SQL databases, and implementing it may require additional development effort and possibly third-party solutions.

In conclusion, while Node.js and SQL databases can work together effectively in many cases, there are inherent complexities and challenges when integrating their asynchronous and synchronous natures. NoSQL databases like MongoDB, with their native JSON support, flexible schema, and asynchronous nature, are often preferred by Node.js developers for their ease of use, scalability, and alignment with JavaScript development principles. However, SQL databases remain a valuable choice for specific use cases, especially when handling complex data relationships or working in environments that require strict data consistency and ACID properties. Ultimately, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases with Node.js depends on the specific project requirements, development team expertise, and the trade-offs developers are willing to make.
