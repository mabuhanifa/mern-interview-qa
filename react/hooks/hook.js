Sure! I can explain all the React hooks without providing actual code examples. Here's an overview of each hook:

1. useState: useState is the most commonly used hook. It allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function to update that state. You can use this function to update the state and trigger a re-render of the component.

2. useEffect: useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components. It accepts a callback function and runs it after every render. You can specify dependencies, and the effect will only be re-run if any of the dependencies change. It can be used for things like data fetching, event listeners, or any other action that needs to be performed after the component renders.

3. useContext: useContext is used to access the value of a React context in a functional component. It accepts a context object created by `React.createContext()` and returns the current context value. This allows components to consume and interact with values provided by an ancestor component without passing them down through props.

4. useReducer: useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It accepts a reducer function and an initial state, and returns the current state and a dispatch function to trigger state updates. It is useful when the state updates depend on the previous state or involve multiple sub-values.

5. useCallback: useCallback is used to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components. It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This can be helpful when passing callbacks to child components to optimize performance.

6. useMemo: useMemo is similar to useCallback, but it memoizes the result of a computation instead of a function. It accepts a function and an array of dependencies and returns the memoized value. This is useful when you have expensive calculations or transformations that don't need to be recomputed on every render.

7. useRef: useRef returns a mutable ref object that persists across re-renders. It can be used to access or store a value that persists between renders, without triggering a re-render when the value changes. It is often used to reference DOM elements, manage focus, or store mutable values in functional components.

8. useLayoutEffect: useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It's useful when you need to perform measurements or other operations that require access to the DOM before the browser paints the screen. In most cases, useEffect should be sufficient.

9. useImperativeHandle: useImperativeHandle is used in conjunction with the forwardRef function to customize the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using the ref prop. It allows you to define which functions or values are accessible from the ref object.

10. useDebugValue: useDebugValue is a hook that can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools. It accepts a value and a formatting function, making it easier to understand the purpose or behavior of a custom hook while debugging.

These are the main React hooks available as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. React may introduce new hooks or updates in the future, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official React documentation for the most up-to-date information.
