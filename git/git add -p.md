`git add -p` is a powerful and interactive command in Git that allows you to selectively stage changes in your working directory to be included in the next commit. The `-p` flag stands for "patch" mode, and it lets you interactively review and choose which changes you want to include in the staging area (index) and subsequently commit.

When you run `git add -p`, Git will present you with each diff (change) that exists between your working directory and the index (staging area) one by one. You will have several options for each diff:

1. `y` - Stage this hunk (part of the change).
2. `n` - Do not stage this hunk.
3. `s` - Split this hunk into smaller hunks.
4. `e` - Manually edit this hunk.
5. `q` - Quit; do not stage any more hunks.
6. `a` - Stage this hunk and all remaining hunks in the file.
7. `d` - Do not stage this hunk nor any remaining hunks in the file.
8. `?` - Display help for these options.

By using this interactive mode, you can carefully review the changes you've made and select only the relevant parts to be included in your next commit. This can be particularly useful when you've made several changes in a file but want to commit them separately or when you want to avoid including temporary debugging code or unrelated changes.

Remember that the changes are not permanently staged until you complete the interactive session. After you have finished staging the desired hunks, you can use `git commit` to create a new commit containing only the selected changes.

Keep in mind that this command is quite powerful but may require some practice to use efficiently. If you're unsure about how to use it, you can always type `h` during the interactive session to access the help menu, which provides more detailed information about the available options.
