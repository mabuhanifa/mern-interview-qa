The `git branch -a` command lists all local branches, including remote-tracking branches. Remote-tracking branches are branches that track branches on a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.

The `-a` flag stands for "all". Without the `-a` flag, the `git branch` command will only list local branches that are not remote-tracking branches.

To use the `git branch -a` command, you need to be in a Git repository. Once you are in a Git repository, you can run the command by typing the following into your terminal:

```
git branch -a
```

The output of the `git branch -a` command will show you a list of all your local branches, including remote-tracking branches. The output will look something like this:

```
* main
  feature/foo
  feature/bar
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/develop
```

The `*` symbol in the output indicates the current branch. In this example, the current branch is `main`.

The `git branch -a` command is a useful way to see all the branches that you have created in your Git repository. This can be helpful if you are trying to track down a particular branch or if you are trying to merge branches.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `git branch -a` command:

- The `git branch -a` command will only list branches that are tracked by Git. If you have created a branch but have not yet committed any changes to it, the branch will not be listed by the `git branch -a` command.
- The `git branch -a` command will not list branches that have been deleted. If you have deleted a branch, it will not be listed by the `git branch -a` command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
