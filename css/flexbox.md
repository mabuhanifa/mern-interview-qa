CSS Flexbox is a layout model in CSS that allows you to create flexible and responsive one-dimensional layouts. It enables you to distribute and align elements within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).

Key concepts of CSS Flexbox:

1. Flex Container: To create a flexbox layout, you define a container element and set it as a flex container using the `display: flex;` property.

2. Flex Items: Elements within the flex container are referred to as flex items. These items can grow, shrink, or maintain their original size based on the flex properties applied to them.

3. Main Axis and Cross Axis: Flexbox operates along two axes. The main axis is the direction in which the flex items are laid out, either horizontally or vertically. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

4. Flex Direction: You can define the direction of the main axis using the `flex-direction` property. Possible values are `row` (horizontal), `column` (vertical), `row-reverse`, and `column-reverse`.

5. Flex Items Alignment: You can control how flex items are aligned within the flex container using properties like `justify-content` (along the main axis) and `align-items` (along the cross axis).

6. Flex Items Ordering: The order in which flex items appear in the flex container can be changed using the `order` property.

7. Flex Items Flexibility: Flex items can grow and shrink to fill available space using the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties. You can also set their initial size using `flex-basis`.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* Items are laid out horizontally */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Items are distributed with space between them along the main axis */
  align-items: center; /* Items are vertically centered along the cross axis */
}

.flex-item {
  flex: 1; /* Flex item will grow to fill available space */
  /* Alternatively, you can set flex properties individually:
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 0;
  */
}
```

In this example, the `.flex-container` is set as a flex container with its items laid out horizontally. The items are distributed with space between them along the main axis and centered vertically along the cross axis. The `.flex-item` is set to grow and fill the available space.

CSS Flexbox provides a straightforward way to create responsive layouts without relying on floats or positioning. It's particularly useful for building navigation menus, card layouts, and centering elements easily.
