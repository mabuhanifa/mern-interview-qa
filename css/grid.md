CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows you to create two-dimensional grid layouts for your web pages. It divides the page into rows and columns, enabling you to easily position and organize elements within the grid.

Key concepts of CSS Grid:

1. Grid Container: To create a grid layout, you define a container element and set it as a grid container using the `display: grid;` property.

2. Grid Tracks: The rows and columns of the grid are called tracks. You can specify the number and size of tracks using properties like `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.

3. Grid Items: Elements within the grid container are referred to as grid items. You can position these items in the grid using properties like `grid-row` and `grid-column`.

4. Grid Lines: The lines separating the rows and columns in the grid are called grid lines.

5. Grid Areas: You can create named grid areas, which allow you to assign multiple grid cells to a specific name. This is useful for larger layout sections.

6. Grid Gap: You can define the space between grid items and grid tracks using the `grid-gap` property.

Example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Three columns with 1 fractional unit, 2 fractional units, and 1 fractional unit width respectively */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Two rows with 100 pixels and 200 pixels height respectively */
  grid-gap: 10px; /* 10-pixel gap between grid items */
}

.grid-item {
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Grid item spans from row 1 to row 3 (inclusive) */
  grid-column: 2; /* Grid item is placed in the second column */
}
```

In this example, the `.grid-container` is set as a grid container with three columns and two rows. The `.grid-item` is positioned to span from the first to the third row and placed in the second column.

CSS Grid provides a flexible and efficient way to create complex layouts, making it easier to design responsive and dynamic web pages.
